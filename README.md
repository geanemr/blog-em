## React query / Tanstack Query Blog

</div>

First project created on the Udemy course [React Query: Server State Management in React](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-react-query/?couponCode=REACT-QUERY-GITHUB)

### Learning summary:
* Install package, create QueryClient and add QueryProvider
* useQuery for data
* staleTime for wheter or not to re-fetch (on trigger)
* gcTime for how long to hold on to data after inactivity
* query keys as dependency arrays
* pagination and pre-fetching
* useMutation for server-side effects

_Side note: In this project, the mutations will not really delete or transform  the content from the API. It is just a demonstration of how queries and mutations work, and their respective states._
